# auto-clicker

Simple Windows auto-clicker with some option for customization. 

To start using:
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/zekissel/auto-clicker.git
```
Download this repository to your current directory.
```bash
  cd auto-clicker/
```
Change directory to downloaded repository.
```bash
  cargo run
```
Compile and run the program.

Use the graphical interface to select the mouse button to be clicked, the number of times it is clicked per cycle, and the time in millseconds between cycles.
It is suggested to move your cursor to where you wish to automatically click, then use the 'G' key on your keyboard to start (and eventually stop) the clicker.

Press 'Q' at any time to quit the program and exit to terminal.
