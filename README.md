# auto-clicker

Simple Windows auto-clicker with some option for customization. 

After downloading and (cargo) running, use the graphical interface to select the mouse button to be clicked, the number of times it is clicked per cycle, and the time in millseconds between cycles.
It is suggested to move your cursor to where you wish to automatically click, then use the 'G' key on your keyboard to start (and eventually stop) the clicker.

Press 'Q' at any time to quit the program and exit to terminal.
